# ColorTiles
The color tile puzzle from UNDERTALE

This is made in Godot, mostly because I'm trying to learn it lol

Rules:
- Pink and green tiles are fine to walk on
- Red tiles you can't walk onto
- Yellow tiles you also can't walk on (they're electric)
- Orange tiles make you orange flavoured
- Purple tiles you slide over, they make you lemon flavoured
- Blue tiles you can't walk on if it's adjacent to a yellow tile, or if you're orange flavoured (they're filled with water which is in turn filled with piranhas. Piranhas like oranges but hate lemons)
