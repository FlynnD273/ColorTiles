# ColorTiles
The color tile puzzle from UNDERTALE

This is made in Godot, mostly because I'm trying to learn it lol

You can copy the seed for the current layout from the pause menu.
Every generated board _should_ be possible to complete. I tried to stay as faithful to the original game as possible, the only major difference being that the green tile is now the goal. 

Rules:
- Pink and green tiles are fine to walk on
- Red tiles you can't walk onto
- Yellow tiles you also can't walk on (they're electric)
- Orange tiles make you orange flavoured
- Purple tiles you slide over, they make you lemon flavoured
- Blue tiles you can't walk on if it's adjacent to a yellow tile, or if you're orange flavoured (they're filled with water which is in turn filled with piranhas. Piranhas like oranges but hate lemons)
